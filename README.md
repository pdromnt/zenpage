# ZenPage+
Chrome (or any Chromium based browser and Firefox) extension that replaces the New Tab page with a personalised homepage, featuring beautiful photography, bookmark management and weather information.

Forked from the original [ZenPage](https://github.com/jack-doyle/zenpage) to fix most issues and refactor the old broken code.

## Features
* High-resolution photography from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)
* Quick links to popular sites
* Categorizable bookmarks
* Weather widget displaying information from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)

## Installing
1. First click in Code > Download Zip > Extract zip  
2. Then in your browser go to Extensions > Enable Developer Mode > Load Unpacked > Select the directory where you extracted the zip  
3. Go to the extension Options page (right-click the extension icon -> Options, or click "Options" on the new tab page).
4. Enter your API keys for Unsplash, PositionStack, and OpenWeatherMap in the "API Keys" section.
5. Done!
  
ProTip: The OpenWeatherMap API Key takes a while to activate, usually up to an hour.  

## Updating

Same process as installing. Your API keys and settings are saved in the browser storage, so they should persist across updates.
